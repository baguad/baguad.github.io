# Docs as Code

Docs as code is a documentation methodology that treats documentation as a first-class citizen in the software development process. This means that documentation is written in the same way as code, using version control, automated testing, and other tools that are commonly used for software development.

There are several benefits to following a docs as code approach to documentation:

- Documentation is always up-to-date. Because documentation is written in the same way as code, it is always up-to-date with the latest changes to the software. This is because documentation is stored in the same version control system as the code, and changes to documentation are tracked and reviewed just like changes to code.
- Documentation is easier to maintain. Because documentation is written in a structured format, it is easier to maintain and update. This is because documentation can be edited using a plain text editor, and changes can be easily reviewed and merged.
- Documentation is easier to test. Because documentation is written in a structured format, it can be easily tested for accuracy and completeness. This is because documentation can be automatically checked for errors, and tests can be run to ensure that documentation is up-to-date with the latest changes to the software.
- Documentation is more accessible. Because documentation is hosted on a website, it is more accessible to users. This is because users can access documentation from anywhere, and they do not need to install any special software to view the documentation.

If you are looking for a way to improve the quality and maintainability of your documentation, then you should consider following a docs as code approach.

Here are some additional reasons why you should follow a docs as code approach to documentation:

- Docs as code can help you improve collaboration between developers and technical writers. When documentation is written in a structured format, it can be easily shared and reviewed by both developers and technical writers. This can help to improve the quality of the documentation, as well as the overall development process.
- Docs as code can help you improve the discoverability of your documentation. When documentation is hosted on a website, it can be easily found by users. This is because users can search for documentation using keywords, and they can also browse documentation by topic.
- Docs as code can help you improve the SEO of your documentation. When documentation is hosted on a website, it can be indexed by search engines. This can help to improve the visibility of your documentation, and it can also help to attract new users to your website.
